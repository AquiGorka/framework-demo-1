#Framework Quick Demo

Just a quick example to show how to use **module** (https://github.com/AquiGorka/module) and **router** (https://github.com/AquiGorka/router)

##What this does:
- Each Module works independently with its own assets: css, imgs, templates, i18n, etc.
- Modules get added/removed from DOM when they acquire/lose focus.


##How To:
- Clone repo and open up index.html

###Notes

- No script loader
